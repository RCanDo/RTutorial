# RTutorial

This tutorial consists of .R files where R commands are explained in comments.
It is concise but comprehensive and rich in information, dense.
Do not expect fast reading -- except the first chapter, each file require few hours of work and deep thought (if you realy want to learn something). 

Currently only 4 chapters, covering the basics of data structures and function writing.

## To be done: 

* plots,
* environments, 
* more on functions, 
* OOP -- S3 & S4 objects and classes,
* mathematics
* basic statistical tools,
* statistical model building.
