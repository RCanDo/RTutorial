# RTutorial

This tutorial consists of .R files where R commands are explained in comments.
It is concise but comprehensive and rich in information, it's dense.
Do not expect fast reading -- except the first chapter, each file require few hours of work and deep thought (if you realy want to learn something). 

## Installation
Install the newest version of R first.
Then one of RStudio or TinnR. 

RStudio environment is similar to Matlab IDE (or Spyder for Python users). 
It's very modern and powerful but quite complicated and do not support user syntax highlighting (only predefined themes which are ugly hence inconvienient). When you open RStudio the R console is opened with it. You're ready to work.

TinnR is somewhat old-fashioned in appearance but very customizable and simple to use. When you open TinnR you should close Terminal, and open R console via R button on the menu bar. Open tutorial file and send lines to console using a button with a single horizontal green line.

Whatever environment you choose, work with this tutorial interactively: send commands line by line to the console. 
The R language is designed as interactive tool for data manipulation and statistical analysis and model building. 
Remember this!
